"-","Glossary Definition","-","Wetness Index","The Wetness Index is a geospatial grid dataset of Wetness Index values for the United States. The Wetness Index is a relative measure of average soil moisture and runoff potential based on topography and is also known as the Topographic Index. The dataset stores a Wetness Index value for each grid pixel based on the magnitude of the pixel's upstream drainage area and pixel slope. The Wetness Index grid was generated from the NHDPlus2 NED Snapshot and NHDPlus2 Flow Accumulation grids using the following steps: (1) the NED Snapshot was used to create a gridded dataset of land surface slope in degrees; (2) a Wetness Index value was calculated for each grid pixel as ln(Flow Accumulation/tan(Slope)); (3) a smoothed Wetness Index grid was calculated as the average of step 2 values in each 3-by-3 pixel block; (4) the final Wetness Index value for each grid pixel was calculated as the average of the unsmoothed value (step 2) and the smoothed value (step 3). The spatial resolution of the Wetness Index grid is 30 meters."
"-","Glossary Definition","-","Watershed (WS)","Watershed (WS) is used to describe indicators that are measured throughout the entire geographic area of the HUC12.

For example, watershed (WS) land cover indicators measure land cover in the entire HUC12 while riparian zone (RZ) land cover indicators measure land cover in the buffer surrounding surface water features in the HUC12."
"-","Glossary Definition","-","Riparian Zone (RZ)","The Riparian Zone (RZ) is the corridor of land adjacent to surface waters. The RZ is delineated for the United States in a geospatial grid dataset depicting surface water features and adjacent buffer areas. The RZ grid was generated by creating a 108 meter buffer around surface waters in the Water Mask grid. The buffer includes areas on both sides of surface waters and the buffer size of 108 meters was selected based on the spatial resolution of the Water Mask grid to approximate a 100 meter buffer. The spatial resolution of the RZ grid is 30 meters. (See also Water Mask glossary definition)."
"-","Glossary Definition","-","Hydrologically Connected Zone (HCZ)","The Hydrologically Connected Zone (HCZ) is comprised of wet areas with high runoff potential that are contiguous to surface water. The HCZ is delineated for the United States for indicator calculations in a geospatial grid dataset depicting surface water features and wet areas that are contiguous to surface water. The HCZ grid was generated using the Wetness Index and Water Mask grids. The Wetness Index grid was first used to identify wet areas based on topography (i.e., low-lying, low-slope areas), defined as pixels with a Wetness Index of 550 or greater. The HCZ was then delineated as wet pixels in the Wetness Index grid that were also contiguous to surface water in the Water Mask.
